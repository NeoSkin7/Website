# About Us

SkinnerMedia is the media organisation of Neo Skinner and is the parent organisation for all of his projects. We aim to combine intelligent web design with insightful content to improve the knowledge of the general public.

## Projects

We've worked on a number of projects over the years, such as [SkinnerScience](https://link.neoski.uk/skinnerscience) and [LearnToCode](https://link.neoski.uk/learntocode) and have active partnerships with the Poole North Scout Group and LocalAreaRadio. Our web-design branch, The Crofton, produces the websites for all of our projects and some of our partners.

You can view our projects [here](https://neoski.uk/projects).
