I have always been producing mathematics content for my website - from interactive activities to step-by-step guides, I’ve been experimenting since day one with how to best present and teach mathematics content. So, what’s new? I have now decided to put all of my mathematics content in one place with my new branch and website: Mathstrolabe!

This leaves me with a few questions to answer I’m sure, so allow me to field just a short summary of the experience you can expect from my new branch:

## The Run-down, What Is It?

The current plan, from the top, is that:

1. Mathstrolabe will host all of my future mathematics content,
2. Be a hub for GCSE mathematics revision,
3. And help not just teachers but students too!

So how does it work?

### 1. Future Content

![Custom Papers](/img/blog/13-08-2023/papers.png)

I am hard at work upon a selection of custom-made GCSE ‘hard’ papers that aim to test students abilities to their full and enable teachers the best possible insight into what students know and what they need to work on. So far, I have completed papers 1 and 2, with paper 3 on the horizon. However, these papers have been designed with mock examinations in mind, so they are locked to public access, but if you are a teacher or an institution you can contact me below to gain full access!

### 2. GCSE Mathematics Revision Hub

In addition to custom papers, I also currently host past papers from 2017 onwards on the website, with some made available to the public here first! I also have a number of question packs sorted by topic and random mixes. Alongside this, there is a collection of good mathematics websites (with my seal of approval) and a section about key ideas and topics.

Furthermore, there are now over 500 past papers that I plan to add to the website in the future, dating back to 2002 - so make sure to keep an eye out for when more papers are made available!

### 3. Help for Students

I hope that the content released onto my new website is suitable for students as well; with a list of websites available to help students and past papers, the website has been designed to work well for both sides of the education system.

In the future, you can expect pages detailing revision advice, exam preparation, and exam dos and don’ts which aim to help students through their challenging examination periods.

## The Current State of Affairs

Currently, the website is available at [maths.neoski.uk](http://maths.neoski.uk) or at the button below and has been optimised for desktop only, although you can expect a mobile version to be made available soon. As always with initial launches, this is still a ‘work in progress’ and it is highly likely that things may not always work as expected or be available, please let me know your thoughts via the contact page if there is anything you would like to see added or anything you think could be changed - I’m always open to suggestions!

Finally, if anyone would like to join the voluntary team and help to shape and develop the website, please contact me on the contact page and I’ll be more than happy to welcome you onto the team!
