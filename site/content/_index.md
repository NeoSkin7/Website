  text: "Neo Skinner is a maverick theoretical physicist and mathematician on a mission to make the world a better and more diverse place through improved education and opportunities. He has worked on many projects and has established a reputation as a science writer and educator through both traditional and contemporary methods. But, that's what he thinks - don't just take it from him, you must hear the opinions and testimonials of others to form a full opinion of any topic."

      When it comes to knowing things that are not taught in schools, Neo definitely knows about them. From the standard model to Hawking Radiation he knows it. He's a naturally skilled teacher who has helped me with my academic studies. This human being is a generational talent and has a hard working mindset that most people my age lack.
