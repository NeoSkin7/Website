  text: "Welcome to my home on the internet. My name is Neo Skinner (or NeoSki) and here you can find my blog, links, contact information, and much more! All the opinions are my own and some areas may be created purely for satirical and comedy purposes. However, I also post some content about myself and (it appears) London. Please enjoy browsing my website and remember to always be wary of what you find elsewhere on the internet!"

Content includes: Internet safety, Science, Computing, Mathematics, and (if you look hard enough) English. I have attended a few eye-opening courses from Imperial College London which have informed some of the content you see here."
