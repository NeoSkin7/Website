# Are you ready?

My online teaching sessions launch on Monday the 9th of January 2023.

## Content

Sessions will cover topics across Science and Mathematics and are suitable for GCSE students aiming for any grade - whether that be a 4 or a 9; grade boundaries don't define attitudes, only you can do that.

Topics will be chosen by you - whatever you want to cover will be covered!
