# Quotations for Your Reference Pleasure

These are all things that I have said or written at one point or another. You can reference them if you like...

> Ever wanted to know the mean life of an electron? Well now you can – it’s more than 66 octillion years!

> [Linked to Above] Or how about the numerical value of Avogadro’s constant? That’s 6.022 140 76 × 10<sup>23</sup> as defined by the BIPM.

> Knowledge is power and nobody can take that away from you.

> Mathematics, the study of logic, reasoning and deduction.

> [Upon Neo Skinner's Ramblings] There used to be a joke that all scientists had to be mad before they could start on something truly ground-breaking and maybe this is what has happened here…

> In his seemingly mundane quest, Planck stumbled across a strange property of light. He found that, for his equations to work, light must be comprised of tiny packets almost like particles.

> Wow, I really have spent a lot of time explaining how proportionality works!

> One thing you must understand about science is that discoveries come in waves – not light or water waves, metaphorical waves representing the peaks of achievements.

> Fermion is just a special word for 'matter elementary particle.'

> Don’t worry if you don’t have a particle collider, we’ll do it theoretically.

> A science book would be incomplete without a discussion of naming conventions and unfortunately for you, I love them!

> Although it is a nice thought, sadly particles do not have feelings otherwise I’d have a queue of particles as large as the universe asking me why they exist. Not good.

> Muons can’t last forever after all.

> Flavour is a physics concept paralleled in consumerism; imagine for a moment that we were shopping – don’t go shopping with a physicist if you wish to keep your sanity – and I asked you what type of ice cream you wanted. You’d probably look at me blankly and say: “type, don’t you mean flavour?” And this in essence is flavour in particle physics, the type of particle.

> [Upon Electromagnetism] Maxwell’s new interaction has a relative strength of 10<sup>36</sup>, that’s like your grandma (gravity) attempting to win a weightlifting competition against the strongest man in the world (electromagnetism)!

> [An Example of the Absurdity of Temperature in the Early Universe] This was apparent in the early universe shortly after the 'big bang' when the universe was only 10<sup>15</sup> K (roughly the same temperature in celsius at this scale).

> In a very similar fashion to people who step in to settle an argument and restore all world order, bosons prevent the worst from happening within the universe – that is the complete lack of law and order within the very prestigious quantum community.

> Photons, as previously expressed, are remarkable things – we experience them every second of our lives as the bouncing balls that allow us to see, but light is a wave, is it not? How can particles come together like starlings to form a murmuration?

> Since mesons are composed of one part matter and one part antimatter (yes, it appears I have branched out into recipe books too now) the interactions between the two particles define the properties of the meson.

> [Upon the Double-Slit Experiment] An electron beam gun [...] would most definitely ionise your coffee.

> Theoretical physics has a gaping hole somewhere between the fundamentals and the beginning of it all.

> The question to ask is not now “What is everything made up of?” but rather the more subtle “How is everything made up?”

> [Upon String Theory] It is important to remember as always in quantum physics that what we call objects and particles are of course scientific constructs arising from a necessary need to analogise physical phenomena for easier understanding; our strings are nothing more than a framework for understanding a single-dimensioned object and their vibration nothing more than a property rather than a physical action.

> Just because our understanding of fields and interactions has so far called upon the use of bosons does not mean that gravity will follow this rule through inevitability.

> [Upon the Properties of Quarks] This is the nature of the universe; everything happens for a reason and things do not simply leap into existence including the very properties of the most fundamental of things.

> [Upon Dimension Compactification] In such a universe it would seem outrageous to even consider that a theory of everything is possible if our best current theory is provably unprovable.

> As a race of intelligent beings, humans have thus far prospered incredibly well on the journey to uncover the hot boiler room of the universe – the ‘big bang.’

> All of physics is composed of approximations, who is to say that a thrown ball does not teleport to the other side of the world by way of a wormhole in an infinitely short amount of time before returning to its apparent position and continuing its Newtonian journey to rest?

> Our understanding of the basic components of nature is founded upon continued approximations that cannot be proven in every possible situation – there is no lim<sub>n→∞</sub> for real life enabling us to rigorously prove every theory and law to an infinite degree.

> I'm not the kind of person to provide basic answers to any question.

> Digital media is a staple of the modern world and, with almost everyone in the developed world with access to the internet, it is a pivotal tool in the transfer of ideas and information.

> There are all manner of different ways in which an unstable atom can decay; from electromagnetic radiation, lighter nuclei, and even neutrinos, nothing is seemingly safe from the unstable nucleus' rampage against itself.

> The universe is a deeply unusual thing.

> Is mathematics truth or an elaborate figment of our imagination?
