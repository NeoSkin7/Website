# EDEX22

The Education Extravaganza 2022 (EDEX22) aims to provide top-set students with challenging content so that they are fully prepared for their GCSE exams. It also helps students to relax and enjoy their final lessons of the year.

## Content

Education Extravaganza 2022 features content-rich lessons to target weak areas of the curriculum and challenge students. This is done using both theory and practical exercises, with lessons planned for maximum enjoyment of every student.

### Demonstrations

The lessons feature the following demonstrations:

- Flame Test for Metal Ions (Physics)

### Theory

All lessons feature a large amount of theory content over the following subjects:

- The Periodic Table and its Development (Chemistry)
- The Reactivity Series (Chemistry)
- Atomic Structure (Physics)
- The Flame Test for Metal Ions and its Limitations (Physics)
- Spectroscopy and Emission Spectra (Physics)
- Electron Excitation (Physics)

## Teaching Instructions

To teach this content, first read through the booklet that students will use - this has all of the content that is taught in the lessons. Then, read through the mark scheme and ensure you understand the answers. Next, look through the presentation that has additional pictures to aid your teaching before finally looking at the demonstrations.

It is good general practice to order demonstrations at least a week in advance of your teaching.

_PS. The tennis ball is for the atom scale section of the Physics lesson and the 1862 Periodic Table is an example for the periodic table history section of the Chemistry lesson, they are not required!_
