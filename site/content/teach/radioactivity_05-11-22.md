A small tutoring session took place on Saturday the 5th of November 2022 upon the subject of radioactivity. The notes from the session have been uploaded below and are suitable for higher-tier GCSE students due to the challenging nature of the beyond GCSE section which adds some A-Level knowledge to the resource towards the aim of stretching students understanding of this topic.
